      Hi! I am a Software Applications Developer at Centene with general
      software development and full-stack development experience. I enjoy
      working in an environment where I can improve my skills alongside an
      innovative team. I am currently leading a project to combine data science
      tools into a unified web application. I am constantly learning new
      technology and tools and have a curiosity for developing new solutions or
      learning the best established solutions.
